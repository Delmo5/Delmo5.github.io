        <h1>Grammar and types</h1>
      </header>
      <p>This chapter discusses JavaScript's basic grammar, variable declarations, data types and literals.</p>
    </section>

        <h1>Basics</h1>
      </header>
      <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Fr端h (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
      <code>const Fr端h = "foobar";</code>
      <p>But, the variable fr端h is not the same as Fr端h because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
      <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
      <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.</p>
      <p>It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
      <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Declarations">
      <header>
        <h1>Declarations</h1>
      </header>
      <p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</p>
      <ul><li>var<br>Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li><li>let
        Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li><li>const
          Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</li></ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
      <header>
        <h1>Comments</h1>
      </header>
      <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
      <code>// a one line comment

      /* this is a longer,
       * multi-line comment
      */
      </code>
      <p>You can't nest block comments. This often happens when you accidentally include a */ sequence in your comment, which will terminate the comment.</p>
      <code>/* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */</code>
        <p>In this case, you need to break up the */ pattern. For example, by inserting a backslash:</p><code>/* You can /* nest comments *\/ by escaping slashes */</code><p>Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
      <header>
        <h1>Declaring variables</h1>
      </header>
      <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
      <ul><li>With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.</li><li>With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope below.)</li></ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Declaration_and_initialization">
      <header>
        <h1>Declaration and initialization</h1>
      </header>
      <p>In a statement like let x = 42, the let x part is called a declaration, and the = 42 part is called an initializer. The declaration allows the variable to be accessed later in code without throwing a ReferenceError, while the initializer assigns a value to the variable. In var and let declarations, the initializer is optional. If a variable is declared without an initializer, it is assigned the value undefined.</p>
      <code>let x;<br>
console.log(x); // logs "undefined"</code>
      <p>In essence, let x = 42 is equivalent to let x; x = 42.</p>
      <p>const declarations always need an initializer, because they forbid any kind of assignment after declaration, and implicitly initializing it with undefined is likely a programmer mistake.</p>
      <code>const x; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration</code>
